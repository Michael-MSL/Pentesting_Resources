# Security_Resources
This repo will contain information on distros, tools & kits I have used when it comes to real time security scenarios & even pentesting

Disclaimer: This is for informational and educational purpose, I will not explain how to use these tools or in what order I use them. That is up for you to determine & decide.

Reminder that this is all coming from a white hats perspective.
